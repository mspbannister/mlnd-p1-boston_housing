Udacity MLND Project 1 - Predicting Boston Housing Prices

This is my submission for Project 1 ('Predicting Boston Housing Prices') on Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. The project brief asked the student to apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.

## List of files
- `boston_housing.ipynb`: completed submission file (Jupyter Notebook)
- `visuals.py`: supporting code (provided by Udacity)
- `housing.csv`: underlying data (described below)

## Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `housing.csv`. As described by [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/tree/master/projects/boston_housing), the modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

**Features**
-  `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling
- `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status
- `PTRATIO`: pupil-teacher ratio by town

**Target Variable**
- `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes
